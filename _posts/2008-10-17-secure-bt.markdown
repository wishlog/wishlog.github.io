A secure BT is needed. we needed ssh to replace telnet.
We also needed BTS to replace BT :)

Goal:
1. Stop packet injection from "legal" party
Checksum is included by sender, if anyone sending packets which is difference from others ban this user
Maintain a ban user list which is constantly updated by bt software
Receive same material two times
2. Stop "legal" party to trace out user
Onion routing
Send packet randomly such that having no evidence for him to upload
this two method is perfect match
3. Stop banned by ISP
Changing port.
Changing rate behavior
